Loopback
======

Loopback base image for quick-starting projects. Dockerfile ensures "loopback-cli" id pre-installed.

A sample project already goes into the "src" folder, but that is not included in the Docker image. The sample project was created with the "lb" command-line tool.

The "runbash.sh" script mounts the "src" folder into "/usr/src".
